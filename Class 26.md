## Here is my Class 26 reading notes

[React hello world](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html)

1. Elements and Components are the two building blocks of a React App.

2. A React element is an object representation of a DOM node. A component encapsulates a DOM tree. Elements are immutable i,e once created cannot be changed. The state in a component is mutable.

3. Advantages of React’s component based architecture.

    It helps the developers create quick and single-page applications and interfaces. React is a component-based library created by Facebook. It creates different user interfaces and manages different component states. Multiple components and tools can make complex applications without losing the state in DOM.

[Introducing JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/introducing-jsx.html)

1. JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.

    JSX produces React “elements”. We will explore rendering them to the DOM in the next section. Below, you can find the basics of JSX necessary to get you started.

    Why JSX?

    React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.

2. Embedding Expressions in JSX

In the example below, we declare a variable called name and then use it inside JSX by wrapping it in curly braces:

3. JSX Prevents Injection Attacks

It is safe to embed user input in JSX: const title = response.potentiallyMaliciousInput; // This is safe
