I definitely agree with the post. I strongly beleive that we have to do thing morally and do not be afraid to call it out. It is not all about the money but also do things according to your own beleives. 

We come to a point that profit lead companies to forget how some projects can affect their customers. I disagree with that and think that ethics is really important in tech and being mindfull of the impact of the products we promote.

Big Tech Company are always looking to make profit no matters how it may affects their customers. I do beleive that if the comaniy behave or promote products your beliefs do not align with it, it is better to look somewhere else.
