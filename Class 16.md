## Here is my Class 16 reading notes

[AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)

1. What is Amazon EC2?

* Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

* Access reliable, scalable infrastructure on demand. Scale capacity within minutes with SLA commitment of 99.99% availability.

* Provide secure compute for your applications. Security is built into the foundation of Amazon EC2 with the AWS Nitro System.
 
* Optimize performance and cost with flexible options like AWS Graviton-based instances, Amazon EC2 Spot instances, and AWS Savings Plans.

2. Use cases

* Run cloud-native and enterprise applications. Amazon EC2 delivers secure, reliable, high-performance, and cost-effective compute infrastructure to meet demanding business needs.

* Scale for HPC applications. 

* Develop for Apple platforms.

* Train and deploy ML applications.

3. One of the biggest advantages is the flexibility to change underlying EC2 instances. As the traffic or demand increases, we can easily change EC2 instances without any issues.
