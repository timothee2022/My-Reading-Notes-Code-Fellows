# Data Structures and Algorithms

1. The first thing to do is look at the fundamental requirements - what are the inputs, what are the outputs, what are the operations in between?

Then, the performance and scale requirements - how much data are we talking about? How frequently will it be accessed?

2. The call stack is not an infinite resource. This is especially true when performing deep recursion. Functions calls within functions are placed on the call stack further up, which means each recursive call sits on the call stack, waiting to be executed.
