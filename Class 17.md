3. S3 Standard offers high durability, availability, and performance object storage for frequently accessed data. Because it delivers low latency and high throughput, S3 Standard is appropriate for a wide variety of use cases, including cloud applications, dynamic websites, content distribution, mobile and gaming applications, and big data analytics. S3 Storage Classes can be configured at the object level and a single bucket can contain objects stored across S3 Standard, S3 Intelligent-Tiering, S3 Standard-IA, and S3 One Zone-IA. You can also use S3 Lifecycle policies to automatically transition objects between storage classes without any application changes.

Key Features:

* Low latency and high throughput performance

* Designed for durability of 99.999999999% of objects across multiple Availability Zones

* Resilient against events that impact an entire Availability Zone

* Designed for 99.99% availability over a given year

* Backed with the Amazon S3 Service Level Agreement for availability

* Supports SSL for data in transit and encryption of data at rest

* S3 Lifecycle management for automatic migration of objects to other S3 Storage Classes

[AWS Lambda Basics](https://www.serverless.com/aws-lambda)

1. What is AWS Lambda?

    AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Users of AWS Lambda create functions, self-contained applications written in one of the supported languages and runtimes, and upload them to AWS Lambda, which executes those functions in an efficient and flexible manner.

    The Lambda functions can perform any kind of computing task, from serving web pages and processing streams of data to calling APIs and integrating with other AWS services.

2. Lambda use cases:

* Individual tasks run for a short time;

* Each task is generally self-contained;

* There is a large difference between the lowest and highest levels in the workload of the application.
