# Class 3

## Here is my Class 3 reading notes

### 1. [Review: ES6 Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)

* Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are not shared with ES5 class-like semantics.
"Quoting from the reading material"

* A class declaration can be hoisted.


### 2. [Using Express Routing](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html)

* Routing refers to how an application’s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests. For an introduction to routing, see Basic routing.

* You define routing using methods of the Express app object that correspond to HTTP methods; for example, app.get() to handle GET requests and app.post to handle POST requests. For a full list, see app.METHOD. You can also use app.all() to handle all HTTP methods and app.use() to specify middleware as the callback function (See Using middleware for details).
"Quoting from the reading material"

* Route paths, in combination with a request method, define the endpoints at which requests can be made. Route paths can be strings, string patterns, or regular expressions while route method is derived from one of the HTTP methods, and is attached to an instance of the express class.

### 3. [Express Routing](https://scotch.io/tutorials/learn-to-use-the-new-router-in-expressjs-4)

* Express Router is a mini express application without all the bells and whistles of an express application, just the routing stuff. Let’s take a look at exactly what this means. We’ll go through each section of our site and use different features of the Router.
"Quoting from the reading material"

* The express.Router() function is used to create a new router object. This function is used when you want to create a new router object in your program to handle requests. 
"Quoting from the reading material"

* Route middleware in Express is a way to do something before a request is processed. This could be things like checking if a user is authenticated, logging data for analytics, or anything else we’d like to do before we actually spit out information to our user.
