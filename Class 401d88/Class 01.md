## 1. How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?

Node.js is a Javascript tool built in Google Chrome's V8 Javascript engine. 

## 2. What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?
The Node. js runtime is the software stack responsible for installing your web service's code and its dependencies and running your service.

## 3. What is Node used for?

Node allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer process itself instead of in a browser. Node can, therefore, be used to write server-side applications with access to the operating system, file system, and everything else required to build fully-functional applications.
