# Class 2

## Here is my Class 2 reading notes

[An introduction to NodeJS and Express](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction)

1. Middleware refers to any behind the scenes software that allows these two levels to communicate and interact with each other.

2. Express is unopinionated. You can insert almost any compatible middleware you like into the request handling chain, in almost any order you like. You can structure the app in one file or multiple files, and using any directory structure. You may sometimes feel that you have too many choices!

3. A module is a JavaScript library/file that you can import into other code using Node's require() function. Express itself is a module, as are the middleware and database libraries that we use in our Express applications.

[What is NPM?](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm)

1. I am using the 8.19.1 npm version

2. I will use npm i jshint

[What is TDD?](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/)

1. Test is important to make sure your codes are working as espected or as you expect them to work. 

2. Continuous Delivery is the automation of steps to safely get changes into production. Where Continuous Deployment focuses on the actual deployment, Continuous Delivery focuses on the release and release strategy.
