Here is my reading notes for Class 3

Source & Reference: Reading Material and w3schools.com

* An unordered list is used to create a list of items or bulleted list.

* You should use an 'ordered list' for items you want to mark with numbers or letters and
use the 'unordered list' for items you want to mark with bullets.

* To change the type of bullets in an unordered list, you will need to change the
list-style-type in the 'ul' element. For example:
"Quoting from w3schools.com"

// 1. ul.a {
  list-style-type: circle;
}
// 2. ul.b {
  list-style-type: square;
}

* To change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list, you need to modify the
the <ol> type element with the desired list items. For example:
"Quoting from w3schools.com"

//1. <ol type="1">
        <li>Mango</li>
        <li>Orange</li>
        <li>Apple</li>
    </ol>  

* Here are the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model:
"Quoting from w3schools.com"

1. Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
2. Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
3. Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
4. Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

* Strings, Numbers, Objects are the type of data that can be stored inside an Array.

* The people array example presented is a vakid JavaScript array. This is an example of a
mix data types in a single array.

* Here are five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript:
"Quoting from reading material: Expressions and operators"

1. Comparaison operators: An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand
2. Arithmetic operators: An arithmetic operator takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value
3. String operators: In addition to the comparison operators, which can be used on string values, the concatenation operator (+) concatenates two string values together, returning another string that is the union of the two operand strings.
4. Relational operators: A relational operator compares its operands and returns a Boolean value based on whether the comparison is true.

* Loop is useful for rapidly completing repetitive tasks, from multiple basic calculations to just about any other situation where you've got a lot of similar items of work to complete
