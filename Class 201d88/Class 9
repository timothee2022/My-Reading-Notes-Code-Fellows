MY READING NOTE 9:
My today reading was about how to structure a web form using HTML and JS.

1. Your first Web Form. How To Structure A Web Form.

* What are web forms?
Web forms are one of the main points of interaction between a user and a web site or application. 
Forms allow users to enter data, which is generally sent to a web server for processing and storage (see Sending form data later in the module), 
or used on the client-side to immediately update the interface in some way (for example, add another item to a list, or show or hide a UI feature).

A web form's HTML is made up of one or more form controls (sometimes called widgets), plus some additional elements to help structure the overall form — 
they are often referred to as HTML forms. The controls can be single or multi-line text fields, dropdown boxes, buttons, checkboxes, or radio buttons, 
and are mostly created using the <input> element, although there are some other elements to learn about too.

Form controls can also be programmed to enforce specific formats or values to be entered (form validation), and paired with text labels that describe their purpose to both sighted and visually impaired users.

* When designing a form, it's important to remember that the bigger your form, the more you risk frustrating people and losing users. Keep it simple and stay focused: ask only for the data you absolutely need.

* Here are 5 forms HTML elements: 

- The <button> element also accepts a type attribute — this accepts one of three values: submit, reset, or button.

- The <label> element is the formal way to define a label for an HTML form widget. This is the most important element if you want to build accessible forms — when implemented properly, 
screenreaders will speak a form element's label along with any related instructions, as well as it being useful for sighted users.

- The <form> element

- The <section> element

- The <li> element

- The <input> element

2. Learn JS

* Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are programming, which the system tells you about so your code can react to them.
For example, if the user clicks a button on a webpage, you might want to react to that action by displaying an information box. In this article, we discuss some important concepts surrounding events, 
and look at how they work in browsers. This won't be an exhaustive study; just what you need to know at this stage.

* Event objects
Sometimes, inside an event handler function, you'll see a parameter specified with a name such as event, evt, or e. This is called the event object, and it is automatically passed to event handlers to 
provide extra features and information. For example, let's rewrite our random color example again slightly:
