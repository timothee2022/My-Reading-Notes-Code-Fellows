Here is my reading notes for Class 4

Source & Reference: Reading Material and w3schools.com

HTML

* A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content, see Block level links, 
inside an <a> element and using the href attribute, also known as a Hypertext Reference, 
or target, that contains the web address.
"Quoting from reading material"

* The href attribute contains additional information about the link, 
such as which kind of information the page contains, or things to be aware of on the website.

CSS Layout

* Normal flow is the way that webpage elements lay themselves out if you haven't changed their layout.
"Quoting from reading material"

* Block-level elements are laid out vertically while inline elements are laid out horizontally

* Static positioning is the default for every html element.

* The key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning is whereas absolute positioning 
fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), 
fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport

JS

* The function declaration is a traditional method to declare a function while
invoking functions is done by including the name of the function in the code somewhere, followed by parentheses.

* The values that are declared within a function when the function is called are known as an argument. 
Whereas, the variables that are defined when the function is declared are known as a parameter.
