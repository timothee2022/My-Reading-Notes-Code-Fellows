Her is my reading notes for Class 12

1.JavaScript Canvas

* Introduction to the HTML5 Canvas element
HTML5 features the <canvas> element that allows you to draw 2D graphics using JavaScript.

The <canvas> element requires at least two attributes: width and height that specify the size of the canvas:
<canvas width="500" height="300" id="canvas"></canvas>

* Fallback content
Unlike the <img> element, The <canvas> element requires the closing tag </canvas>. Any content between the opening and closing tags is fallback content that will display only if the browser doesnâ€™t support the <canvas> element

* The rendering context
Initially, the canvas is blank. To draw something, you need to access the rendering context and use it to draw on the canvas.

The <canvas> element features the getContext() method that returns a render context object.

The getContext() takes one argument which is the type of context. For example, you use the "2d" to get a 2D rendering context object, which is an instance of the CanvasRenderingContext2D interface.

The 2D rendering context allows you to draw shapes, text, images, and other objects.

The following example shows how to select the canvas element using the querySelector() method and access the drawing context by calling its getContext() method:
let canvas = document.querySelector('#canvas');
let ctx = main.getContext('2d');
