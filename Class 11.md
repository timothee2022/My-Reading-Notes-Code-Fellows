[Event Driven Programming](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nodejs-event-driven-programming)

1. Event-Driven Programming is a logical pattern that we can choose to confine our programming within to avoid issues of complexity and collision. In this article weâ€™re going to go over how Event-Driven Programming works and how we can make the best use of it in our Node.js projects.

      Event-Driven Programming makes use of the following concepts:

      An Event Handler is a callback function that will be called when an event is triggered.
A Main Loop listens for event triggers and calls the associated event handler for that event.

2. The Object Oriented approach promotes the idea that all behavior of an individual unit (or object) be handled from code within that unit. Using this approach, applications are built with many different units that all speak to and interact with each other.
