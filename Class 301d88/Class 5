My Class 5 Reading Notes

1. The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
The idea behind the SRP is that every class, module, or function in a program should have one responsibility/purpose in a program. As a commonly used definition, "every class should have only one reason to change".

2. To build a static version of your app that renders your data model, you’ll want to build components that reuse other components and pass data using props. props are a way of passing data from parent to child. If you’re familiar with the concept of state, don’t use state at all to build this static version. State is reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time. Since this is a static version of the app, you don’t need it.

3. The three questions you can ask to determine if something is state: 
* Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
* Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
* Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.

4. Higher-Order Functions
Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu were boasting about the size of their latest programs. ‘Two-hundred thousand lines,’ said Tzu-li, ‘not counting comments!’ Tzu-ssu responded, ‘Pssh, mine is almost a million lines already.’ Master Yuan-Ma said, ‘My best program has five hundred lines.’ Hearing this, Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu were enlightened.

5. map() and reduce() access the array they are being applied to. And not just for arrays either, but with any higher order function like toString() or toLowerCase().
