My Class 14 Reading Notes

1. During the beginning of the decline of women in computer science, other areas like Medical, Law and Physical Science Schools was in a rise.

2. It does matter for males that had been playing on computers. They have more chance to end up in the Tech industries. That increase they desire and interest in the field.

3. With diversity comes multiple perspectives. When team members bring a variety of backgrounds, cultures, and experiences, they are more likely to solve problems and be innovative. This can lead to more thoroughly vetted results. Leaders are also more likely able to make better decisions based on facts.

4. Diversity help companies and organization growth. Having a different point of view and prospectives make a huge change.
