# Prep: The Growth Mindset

1. The mistake most weak pianists make is playing, not practicing. If you walk into a music hall at a local university, you’ll hear people ‘playing’ by running through their pieces. This is a huge mistake. Strong pianists drill the most difficult parts of their music, rarely, if ever playing through their pieces in entirety.

I like this part of the reading material. To grow, you need to get out of your confort zone and try something new you have never experienced before.

Growing my mindest, I need to work on my weakness while improving my strongest skills. I will have to balance and both (strongest and weakest) of my sills

2. The key ideas behind deliberate practice is that it:

Pushes you just outside your comfort zone
Repeated often
Feedback on results in continuously available
It's highly demanding mentally
It's difficult
It requires good goals
